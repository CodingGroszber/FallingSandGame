**This design makes your game more configurable and easily expandable.** Each type of material is a subclass of `Material` and overrides the `Interact` method to define its behavior when it interacts with another material. This makes it easy to add new types of materials: just define a new subclass of `Material`.

You would then update your game logic to call the `Interact` method whenever two materials come into contact. This is a simplified example and you might need to adjust it to fit your specific game mechanics and physics engine. For example, you might need to take into account the direction of movement, the relative densities of the materials, etc. But hopefully, this gives you a starting point.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further help!

```csharp
public abstract class Material
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public float Density { get; set; }
    public Color Color { get; set; }

    // Define the behavior when this material interacts with another material
    public abstract Material Interact(Material other);
}

public class Sand : Material
{
    public Sand()
    {
        Name = "Sand";
        Density = 1.0f;
        Color = new Color(194, 178, 128);
    }

    public override Material Interact(Material other)
    {
        // Sand does not react to anything
        return this;
    }
}

public class Water : Material
{
    public Water()
    {
        Name = "Water";
        Density = 0.8f;
        Color = new Color(0, 0, 255);
    }

    public override Material Interact(Material other)
    {
        if (other is Fire)
        {
            return new Steam();
        }
        return this;
    }
}
// Define other materials (Oil, Fire, Steam, Smoke) in a similar way

Material material1 = GetMaterialAtPosition(x, y);
Material material2 = GetMaterialAtPosition(x, y + 1);  // The material below

if (material1 != null && material2 != null)
{
    Material result = material1.Interact(material2);
    SetMaterialAtPosition(x, y, result);
}
